\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
As a data scientist, my mission is to help companies to gain a competitive edge
by solving business problems utilising machine learning and data-visualisation.
Furthermore, my passion is to make these impacts well understood by being able
to explain the process and results clearly and simply to stakeholders.

\lettersection{Why I am applying for this job?}
I would be overjoyed to work at IBM because I am actively seeking out experienced data
scientists to collaborate and expand my knowledge with. I am also very interested
in work environments that promote collaboration and to gain varied experience in
different industries. Exposure to a range of business problems will lead me to grow
substantially as a data scientist.

\lettersection{How can I help IBM?}

During my nanodegree with Udacity, I worked with real-world datasets that sometimes
required extensive data wrangling before analysis in R and Python notebook environments.
(i.e. Jupytr, R-markdown) I also know how to use machine learning techniques within
these languages and how to check the performance of these models to prevent overfitting
using confusion matrices (Predicion, Recall) and K-fold cross-validation. I also
used git repositories to assist with version control.

I have strong interpersonal and communication skills from giving multiple
presentations during my MChem degree at The University of Edinburgh and at my time
at DPDHL as can be seen by my reference from  my internship written by Mr.
Michael Mirus. (See attached.)

Finally, I am an international student who has lived in various countries such as
Phoenix, Prague, Bonn and Edinburgh, I have extensive experience in working with
diverse groups of people and seek out opportunities to learn about other cultures.

\lettersection{Conclusion}
In short, I believe I would make an excelent candidate for this position because I
have practical experience analyzing data using machine learning, statistics
in both Python and R, presenting these findings using visualisation methods (Tableau),
and because of my strong emphasis on understanding the needs of a business and to
communicate with others.

I would like to thank you for reading my application and considering me for the
position or any other position you think would be suitable. I wish you and your
co-workers at IBM the best in your endeavours for the future.
