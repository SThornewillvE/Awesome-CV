# Simons CV

## Description

This is the CV that I want to use for my upcoming job hunt.

This is a template which was found on [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/awesome-cv/dfnvtnhzhhbm),
I have changed it to fit my own purposes but the general format is still rather
close to the original.

I have made some small changed to the original layout based on trying to make
the format a little more compressed and to suit it better for individuals who
are trying to make an entry-level cv. 

## Important files & Installation Notes

  * This file was compiled using XeLaTeX.
  * Changes to the formatting of the file can be made in the awesome-cv.cls class
  file.
  * Files used for sections of the CV can be found in the CV folder, the cv.tex.
  file then inputs these files and compiles them together.
  * I have not made any changes to the coverletter.tex file yet, changes will come
  at a later date.
