## Notes

* States your goals for employment, typically one or two sentences.
* The most effective one is for the job you are applying for:
  * What kind of job am I seeking?
  * What skills do I have that make me ideal?
  * Where have I been and where do I want to go?
* Write a new objective for each job you apply for
* Only talk about goals feasible within the company
* Include information that highlights your experience
* Make sure that the objective is not all your hopes and dreams or something too generic
Keep in mind what the company needs/wants
* Takes the form of:
  > "Seeking a position at [Company] where I can, [goals], utilizing my [skills]

  or

  >"[Person] seeking position in [Company] where I can apply [skills]"
* Make sure that the objective is not all your hopes and dreams or something too generic
* Keep in mind what the company needs/wants
