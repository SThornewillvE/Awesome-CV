# Simons CV

## Description

This is the CV that I want to use for my upcoming job hunt.

This is a template which was found on [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/awesome-cv/dfnvtnhzhhbm),
I have changed it to fit my own purposes but the general format is still rather
close to the original.

What I like about this template is the use of modern fonts and being able to add
social media links into the headder. From my research listening to recruiters and
hiring managers for data scientists is that they really like being able to see your
work.

The rest of the CV has a very crisp and clean style which is easy to navigate and
quickly draw information from, although there are several design choices that I
would have made differently.

  * It's clear that the original Author (Park) has a lot of experience and has made his font very small in order to accommodate for his jam-packed CV. It means people need to strain their eyes to read the text, which is uncomfortable and should be avoided if possible.
  * Grey is used to deemphasize, the shade of grey chosen here is probably a little too strong such that it's hard to read the text.
  * Coloring the first 3 letters of a section title does not add any extra information
  and is edgy for the sake of it, I've simply colored the whole word to help draw attention to the headers without prompting the reader to ask why only
  the first three notes are colored. (A good alternative to this would be to just color the first letter as well.)
  * My name and my website length is a little longer and so I've had to change the
  header width in order to make sure everything stays on one line when adding my
  picture. (Living in central Europe means that people often prefer having a picture
  rather than not, such as in the UK.)
  * Having less experience (relative to Park) means that I've had to cut some sections from the original and add others.

## Important files & Installation Notes

  * This file was compiled using XeLaTeX.
  * Changes to the formatting of the file can be made in the awesome-cv.cls class
  file.
  * Files used for sections of the CV can be found in the CV folder, the cv.tex.
  file then inputs these files and compiles them together.
  * I have not made any changes to the coverletter.tex file yet, changes will come
  at a later date.
