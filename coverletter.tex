  \lettersection{About Me}
  As a data scientist, my mission is to solve business problems by using machine
  learning techniques and communicating the methods/results clearly to technical
  and non-technical stakeholders. I am committed to life-long learning and
  curiosity to continue my growth in a constantly shifting field.

  \lettersection{Why am I applying at [Company] and how can I help?}
  I would be overjoyed to work at [Company] because I am actively seeking out
  experienced data scientists to collaborate and expand my knowledge with. I am
  also very interested in work environments that promote collaboration and
  gaining varied experience in different industries. Exposure to a range of
  business problems will lead me to grow substantially as a data scientist,
  which is why I am applying for this position.

  During my nanodegree with Udacity, I did a project where I performed an
  AB-test on e-commerse data using python. I simulated the predicted outcome
  under a null-hypothesis and compared the difference between the real data and
  calculated the probability of this outcome (p-value). I compared these with a
  logistic regression and found that both of these models predicted that the
  change was likely the result of random chance. If this project had been done
  in a business setting then this would have the potential to prevent a poor
  design choice being made to the company website.

  During my internship at DPDHL, I wrote an Invoice/Order matching algorithm
  with python. Challenges accompanying this project was finding keywords and
  associations between words and ranked the best possible matches so that a
  human could quickly choose the correct decision. The algorithm is currently in
  production and makes the matching process more efficient. This shows that I am
  not only able to tackle large problems but I am also able to implement and
  explain the use of these tools so they can be used in my absence.

  \lettersection{Conclusion}
  In short, I believe I would make an excellent candidate for this position
  because I have experience in tackling complex problems using the tools that
  would be required for this position. I have practical experience analyzing
  data using machine learning in both Python and R and presenting these findings
  to others.

  Thank you for reading my application and considering me for the position or
  any other position you think would be suitable. I currently have flexible
  availability for interview scheduling and genuinely look forward to future
  communication. I can be reached via the contact information or situated in the
  header email anytime. LinkedIn or email works best to arrange a call. I wish
  you and your co-workers at [Company] the best in your endeavours for the future.
